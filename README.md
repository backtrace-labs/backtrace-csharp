# Documentation  <a name="documentation"></a>

## Initialize new BacktraceClient <a name="documentation-initialization"></a>

You can initialize `BacktraceClient` instance via `BacktraceCredential` or application configuration where credentials are stored.

You can check Backtrace credential section in `App.config` file in `Backtrace.Examples` project. See example below to check `App.config` file:

```xml
<configuration>
  <configSections>
    <section name="BacktraceCredentials" type="System.Configuration.NameValueSectionHandler"/>
  </configSections>

  <BacktraceCredentials>
    <add key="HostUrl" value="Your host Url"/>
    <add key="Token" value="Your access token"/>
  </BacktraceCredentials>

  ....
</configuration>
```

In C# code you can initialize new BacktraceClient with section :

```csharp
 var backtraceClient = new BacktraceClient("BacktraceCredentials");
 ```

 If you don't pass a section name to `BacktraceClient`, `BacktraceCredentials` section  will be used.

You can use `BacktraceCredential` class to create new instance of `BacktraceClient`. 

```csharp
var credentials = new BacktraceCredentials("backtraceHostUrl", "accessToken");
var backtraceClient = new BacktraceClient(credentials);
```

Additionally `BacktraceClient` constructor accepts report attributes, database directory path and maximum number of report send per minute. These arguments are optional.

```csharp
var backtraceClient = new BacktraceClient(
    sectionName: "BacktraceCredentials",
    attributes: new Dictionary<string, object>() { { "Attribute", "value" } },
    databaseDirectory: "pathToDatabaseDirectory",
    reportPerMin: 0
);
```

If parameter `reportPerMin` is equal to 0, there is no limit for number of reports sending per minute. If you want to send more reports than `reportPerMin` value, `Send` method will return false.

`DatabaseDirectory` parameter is optional. Make sure that there are no files in directory passed in `databaseDirectory`. BacktraceClient will use this directory to save additional information about executed program. If `databaseDirectory` path is provided, library will generate and attach to report a minidump automatically

## Sending a report <a name="documentation-sending-report"></a>

To send a new report to Backtrace API you have to use instance of `BacktraceClient`. Use `Send` method to send a new report. You can use overridden versions of `Send` method. See examples below to learn how to send a new `BacktraceReport` to server:

### Use BacktraceReport

You can send a report to server by using `BacktraceReport` class. `BacktraceReport` override a generic class `BacktraceReportBase`. `T` argument is used to determinate type of values in attributes dictionary. To `BacktraceReport` constructor you can add new additional information about report by using `attributes` dictionary and attachments by passing array of paths to `attachmentPaths`.
```csharp
try
{
  //throw exception here
}
catch (Exception exception)
{
    var report = new BacktraceReport(
        exception: exception,
        attributes: new Dictionary<string, object>() { { "AttributeString", "value" } },
        attachmentPaths: new List<string>() { @"path to file attachment", @"patch to another file attachment" }
    );
    backtraceClient.Send(backtraceReport);
}
```

### Use overridden methods
`BacktraceClient` can create report for you. You can use overridden `Send` methods and pass string messsage or received exception. 

```csharp
try
{
  //throw exception here
}
catch (Exception exception)
{
  backtraceClient.Send(exception);
  backtraceClient.Send("Message");
}
```

Additionally `BacktraceReport` constructor accepts report attributes and attachment paths. These arguments are optional.
```csharp
 var report = new BacktraceReport(
    exception: exception,
    attributes: new Dictionary<string, object>() { { "AttributeString", "string" } },
    attachmentPaths: new List<string>() { "path to file attachment", "another path" }
);
```
If you add path to files stored on hard drive, send report will attach all files from variable attachmentPaths.


## Events  <a name="documentation-events"></a>

`BacktraceClient` allows you to add your custom events. You can add methods that will trigger event before `Send` method, after `Send` method or to check report information before sending.
 
```csharp
 //Add your own handler to client API
backtraceClient.BeforeSend =
    (Model.BacktraceData<object> model) =>
    {
        var data = model;
        //do something with data for example:        
        data.Attributes.Add("eventAtrtibute", "EventAttributeValue");
        if(data.Classifier == null || !data.Classifier.Any())
        {
            data.Attachments.Add("path to attachment");
        }

        return data;
    };
```           
`BacktraceClient` allows you to add custom events that will trigger after server response. You can add new events when server is temporary unvailable `WhenServerUnvailable` or when you receive response from server `OnServerResponse`.

## Customization <a name="documentation-customization"></a>

`BacktraceClient` and `BacktraceReport` allows you to use your own generic attributes and your own implementation. You can override `BacktraceReportBase` and `BacktraceBase` to create your own client/report implementation. You can check `BacktraceClient` or `BacktraceReport` implementation to check how to prepare your custom reporting tool. 

# Architecture  <a name="architecture"></a>

## BacktraceReport  <a name="architecture-BacktraceReport"></a>
**`BacktraceReport`** - Class that describe single instance of prepared user report. As user you can pass to `Send` method `Exception` or custom message. `BacktraceReport` use base class `BacktraceReportBase`. `BacktraceReportBase` allows you to add your custom logic to any report. You can override `BacktraceReportBase` and create your custom `BacktraceReport`. Keep in mind - `BacktraceClient` uses `CallingAssembly` information to send valid data about your application. `BacktraceReportBase` is a generic class. `T` argument is a value type in `Attribute` dictionary.

## BacktraceClient  <a name="architecture-BacktraceClient"></a>
**`BacktraceClient`** - class that allows you to create single client instance to prepare integration with `Backtrace API`. As user you want to use class to prepare connection with `BacktraceApi`, set client behaviour (saving minidump files on your local hard drive or set rate limiting). `BacktraceClient` uses base class `BacktraceBase`. You can use `BacktraceBase` to add your custom logic. `BacktraceBase`is a generic class. `T` argument is a value type in `Attribute` dictionary.

## BacktraceData  <a name="architecture-BacktraceData"></a>
**`BacktraceData`** - serializable class that stores all values necessary to create diagnostic `JSON` sending to `Backtrace API`. `BacktraceData` is a generic class. You can check prepared data and change it via `BeforeSend` event. `BacktraceData` require `BacktraceReport` and `BacktraceClient` client attributes.

## BacktraceApi  <a name="architecture-BacktraceApi"></a>
**`BacktraceApi`** - class that allows you to send diagnostic JSON to `Backtrace API`. `BacktraceApi` is initialized on `BacktraceClient` start. You can prepare custom events for `BacktraceApi`:
- `RequestHandler` - allows you to override `Send` method. Event triggers with 3 parameters - uri, header and formdata bytes. If RequestHandler is available, Send method wont be triggered.
- `WhenServerUnvailable` -   Set an event executed when received bad request, unauthorize request or other information from server.
- `OnServerAnswer` - Set an event executed when server return information after sending data to API.

BacktraceAPI allows you to send synchronous and asynchronous reports to server. To prepare asynchronous report (default is synchronous) you have to change `AsynchronousRequest` property to true.

## BacktraceDatabase  <a name="architecture-BacktraceDatabase"></a>
**`BacktraceDatabase`** - class that allows you to store data in hard drive. `BacktraceDatabase` instance is initialized on `BacktraceClient` start. If `database path` isn't available on `BacktraceClient` constructor, `BacktraceDatabase` won't generate minidump files. Before start - make sure that **Backtrace database directory** is **empty**. 

## ReportWatcher  <a name="architecture-ReportWatcher"></a>
**`ReportWatcher`** - class that validate all send request to `Backtrace API`. If rate limiting variable is set on `BacktraceClient` constructor, `Watcher` limits all request to a server per minute.
